  This criterion evaluates the robustness, functionality, and overall quality of the technical implementation. Judges will assess the code's efficiency, the absence of critical bugs, and the successful execution of the project's core features.

- **Solution Architecture & Documentation **  
  This focuses on the clarity, maintainability, and thoughtful design of the project's architecture. This includes assessing the organization and readability of the codebase, as well as the comprehensiveness and conciseness of documentation (e.g., GitHub README, inline comments) that enables others to understand and potentially reproduce or extend the solution.
